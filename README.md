# CSC3007-project

## Introduction
This project is broken into two milestones:
* Milestone One requires the team to go through and critique/validate a visualization case study and present to the audience the problems in the visualization and how it can be fixed.
* Milestone Two is to choose either one of the problems presented in Milestone One (e.g., fixing the problem) to improvise it.

### Learning Objectives
* To gain experience designing a moderately complex visualization.
* To gain experience working in a development team.
